  - 'My son, it is now time for you to leave the house and become a man of your own. '
  - "It won\u2019t be long until the mages take full control of the magic in colour,
    now is the time to act and restore peace to our world. "
  - Come with me, there is something important I need to show you.
  - 'This paint brush has been passed down in our lineage from generation to generation. '
  - 'Due to our ancestral standing; through this brush, we too can harness the powers
    of the colour, but you must make sure you can obtain all the colours needed to
    wield the brush to its full potential. '
  - I know this may be a lot and its all coming to you so fast, but it is of great
    importance that you take on this dangerous mission of exploration.
  - Now collect the brush
