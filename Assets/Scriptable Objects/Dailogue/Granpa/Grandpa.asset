  - This paint brush has been passed down in our lineage from generation to generation.
    Due to our ancestral standing;
  - '; through this brush, we too can harness the powers of the colour, but you must
    make sure you can defeat all these enemies so that the swamp and desert can be
    restored back to their peaceful states. '
  - ' Throughout your travels you should use your explorative intuition to find out
    about our world and find out the secrets behind how to defeat the mages.'
