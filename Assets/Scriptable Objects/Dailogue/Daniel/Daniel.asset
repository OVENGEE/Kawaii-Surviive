  - "Ah, welcome, traveler. You look unfamiliar... not from around here, are you?
    Hmm, the Green region, you say? And you're here to clear the area \u2014 searching
    for the old artefacts to unlock the true power of your brush? How fascinating."
  - "Then you must know of the Sect of Mages and their twisted creations. They've
    planted their cursed Crabs, drawn from the eternal water source, and now\u2026
    the temple is sealed to us. Inaccessible. Dangerous."
  - "If it\u2019s the history and artefacts you seek, head to the old building just
    south of here. But be warned \u2014 that path leads through the desert, and danger
    lurks with every shifting dune. This task is not for the faint of heart you say."
  - Hah! I admire your confidence. May it carry you far.
  - "Go then. Survive if you can, and keep searching the abandoned buildings. The
    answers you seek\u2026 and perhaps our salvation\u2026 lie within the temple.
    May your brush guide you well."
