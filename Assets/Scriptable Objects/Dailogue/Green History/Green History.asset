  - The ancient healers of the Green tribe used their magic in order to restore life
    to the natural world our forefathers lived in, and bring restoration to the health
    of the very same people that lived off that land.
  - They were a tribe of farmers that strived off the fertile soil and made green
    armour dyes that added vitality to the soldiers. But the Sect of Mages used this
    power to harness darkness.
  - 'They filled the soldiers with envy for the more prominent tribes and this caused
    them to lead a great attack on the Green nation leaving half the population wiped
    out, and the rest enslaved while others lived as nomads. '
