  - 'The people of the Red Region were known for their political prowess and their
    immense wealth economically and culturally among the people despite living in
    the desert. They were the centre of the trade network between regions and were
    a very peaceful nation. '
  - 'They focused their resources on scientific and theological research, which allowed
    them to effectively create an eternal water source that kept the nation sustained
    in the harsh desert conditions and wind machines to keep cool in the harsh heat. '
  - 'They played a huge role in helping the other regions develop their economies
    and infrastructure at an efficient rate. However, due to their lack of military
    forces and peaceful nature, the Sect of Mages was able to plant spies within
    the political ranks and used the wealth of the Red nation to cripple them from
    the inside. '
  - "This sent the populus into a state of mania and all those that could left the
    Red Nation to bunker up in different desolate areas around the desert, while
    some of the populus went to their secure locations set up when the Sect first
    came to light Many believe that due to their research, the seed for the Sect\u2019s
    evil was able to come to fruition . "
  - 'This gave the Mages access to the wealth that came from the Red and through
    that they were able to attain wealth and infrastructure to run their operations '
